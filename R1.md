## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2019/2020

### Day 1: December 26, 2019. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time revisiting freecodecmap html basics that was completed in Oct 2019. No logged progress via #100daysofcode, starting fresh.  Now back to a rigorous roadmap studying front end dev on my own.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: December 27, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenges so far that have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. Discovered how to overall structure a page.

**Thoughts:** Was stuck on using value attributes with radio buttons and checkbox's.  Figured it out after resetting the code 4 times.  It was all in the placement.
