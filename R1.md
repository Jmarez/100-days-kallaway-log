## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2019/2020

### Day 1: December 26, 2019. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time revisiting freecodecmap html basics that was completed in Oct 2019. No logged progress via #100daysofcode, starting fresh.  Now back to a rigorous roadmap studying front end dev on my own.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: December 27, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenges so far that have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. Discovered how to overall structure a page.

**Thoughts:** Was stuck on using value attributes with radio buttons and checkbox's.  Figured it out after resetting the code 4 times.  It was all in the placement.

### Day 3: December 28, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Began freecodecamps(fcc) CSS tutorials covering the following: text color, style elements with class, font size, font family, image google font import, how fonts should degrade, image sixe, add borders around image, border radius, circular image and background color.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed this mornings CSS tutorials because color and space are my natural talents. I struggled adding multiple class styles to an element.  Watched a video to discover a simple space is all that was needed.

### Day 6: December 31, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started fcc's Applied Visual design turorials.  Learned the basics of visual design and how it can influence it's presentation and UX.  Width & height properties, applied CSS to create tags that changed the appearance of text, and changed an elements position.  

**Thoughts:** Reviewing what I've learned so far in CSS for the reaminder of the day. It's helpful that I've had a strong design background, learning to apply design basics in code is new for me, not the concepts.
