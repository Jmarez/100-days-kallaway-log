## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2019/2020

### Day 1: December 26, 2019. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time revisiting freecodecmap html basics that was completed in Oct 2019. No logged progress via #100daysofcode, starting fresh.  Now back to a rigorous roadmap studying front end dev on my own.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: December 27, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenges so far that have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. Discovered how to overall structure a page.

**Thoughts:** Was stuck on using value attributes with radio buttons and checkbox's.  Figured it out after resetting the code 4 times.  It was all in the placement.

### Day 3: December 28, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Began freecodecamps CSS tutorials covering the following: text color, style elements with class, font size, font family, image google font import, how fonts should degrade, image sixe, add borders around image, border radius, circular image and background color.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed this mornings CSS tutorials because color and space are my natural talents. I struggled on how to add multiple class styles to an element.  Watched a video to discover a simple space is all that was needed.
