### Day 2: December 27, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenges so far that have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. Discovered how to overall structure a page.

**Thoughts:** Was stuck on using value attributes with radio buttons and checkbox's.  Figured it out after resetting the code 4 times.  It was all in the placement.

### Day 3: December 28, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Began freecodecamps(fcc) CSS tutorials covering the following: text color, style elements with class, font size, font family, image google font import, how fonts should degrade, image sixe, add borders around image, border radius, circular image and background color.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed this mornings CSS tutorials because color and space are my natural talents. I struggled adding multiple class styles to an element.  Watched a video to discover a simple space is all that was needed.

### Day 6: December 31, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started fcc's Applied Visual design turorials.  Learned the basics of visual design and how it can influence it's presentation and UX.  Width & height properties, applied CSS to create tags that changed the appearance of text, and changed an elements position.  

**Thoughts:** Reviewing what I've learned so far in CSS for the reaminder of the day. It's helpful that I've had a strong design background, learning to apply design basics in code is new for me, not the concepts.

### Day 7: January 1, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Happy New year!  Got up bright an early to start 2020 off at the gym, roasted in the sauna and jumped in the pool for a floating meditaion (a natural high), then back home to code.  Continued working on visual design today.  Hover state, relative positining, changed font size, weight, line height.  

**Thoughts:** I spend hours reviewing what I've learned and hours learning new things.  I work on front end 8 hours a day on my own, and record about 1 hour here.  Repeat tomorrow. Learning a lot! #professionalsabbatical

### Day 11: January 5, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fcc CSS animation properties and how the animation should behave & the @keyframe rules control what happens during the animation.  Spending a couple more hours disecting cubic-benzier on my own.
