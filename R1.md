### Day 1: December 26, 2019. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time revisiting freecodecmap html basics that was completed in Oct 2019. No logged progress via #100daysofcode, starting fresh.  Now back to a rigorous roadmap studying front end dev on my own.

### Day 2: December 27, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the challenges so far that have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. Discovered how to overall structure a page.

### Day 3: December 28, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Began freecodecamps(fcc) CSS tutorials covering the following: text color, style elements with class, font size, font family, image google font import, how fonts should degrade, image sixe, add borders around image, border radius, circular image and background color.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed this mornings CSS tutorials because color and space are my natural talents. I struggled adding multiple class styles to an element.  Watched a video to discover a simple space is all that was needed.

### Day 4: December 29, 2019 Sunday

**Thoughts:** Reviewing what I've learned so far in CSS for the reaminder of the day. It's helpful that I've had a strong design background, learning to apply design basics in code is new for me, not the concepts.

### Day 7: January 1, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Happy New year!  Got up bright an early to start 2020 off at the gym, roasted in the sauna and jumped in the pool for a floating meditaion (a natural high), then back home to code.  Continued working on visual design today.  Hover state, relative positining, changed font size, weight, line height.  

**Thoughts:** I spend hours reviewing what I've learned and hours learning new things.  I work on front end 8 hours a day on my own, and record about 1 hour here.  Repeat tomorrow. Learning a lot! #professionalsabbatical

### Day 15: January 9, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fcc's CSS flexbox.  My biggest challenge was overcoming what I thought was a bug in a flexbox challenge.  The "bug" was actaully the adblocker disbaling my abilty to see a button.  Learning to code is not only about learning syntax and algorithms but how the system as a whole communicates.  Lots to learn..  

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed learning CSS' flexbox, but mostly enjoyed overcoming the adblock "bug"
